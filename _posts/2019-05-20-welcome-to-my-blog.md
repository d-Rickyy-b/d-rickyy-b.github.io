Hello and welcome. It's nice to see that you found your way to my blog.

In my blog I want to write about different stuff I come across in my life in IT. Mostly it will touch any of the following topics: Programming, Malware, Phishing, IT Security, Reverse Engineering, cool Software, Hacking and possibly also other stuff.
While I already got some sort of blog ([a Telegram channel](https://t.me/C0D3BA5E)), I still wanted to use this blog to write articles which you can share. Articles in this blog will (hopefully) also reach far more into the depth of a topic. In my Telegram channel I rarely explain backgrounds - this is the right place for it.

Let's see how this will work out. I won't publish articles after a certain schedule, so be surprised.

If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me on Telegram](). Thanks for reading, see you around.

Greetings,  
Rico
