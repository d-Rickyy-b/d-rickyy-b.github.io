Have you ever gotten questions about what's the best software for a certain purpose? Well, I get these questions all the time, and that's the main reason why I thought I should set up a list with my all-time favorite software, which I use a lot.

Apart from getting asked a lot, there is also another reason why I wrote this post: setting up a new computer or reinstalling the OS on your current computer for whatever reason is quite annoying. The part that annoys me the most is downloading the software I use. In most cases, you forget about the one thing you use occasionally, and when you need it a few days or weeks later, it's not there.

That list is, of course, not only valid for fresh installations but also for older installations - maybe you find some useful software within this list.

### Software Updates

It's quite annoying to keep your software up-to-date. Often, you need to open the vendor's site, download an `.exe` or `.zip`-archive, run an installer, copy files from here to there, and so on. And since outdated software is a huge security issue, I wondered how to overcome that problem.

- [UCheck](https://www.adlice.com/download/ucheck/#download) - A free software updater with a nice GUI
- [SUMo](https://kcsoftwares.com/index.php?sumo) - **S**oftware **U**pdate **Mo**nitor, another free software update
